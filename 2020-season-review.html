										2020, the year that most people want to forget. It started
										out like any other year, a week into it though I was
										unemployed, getting let go for the first time in my life
										(that was’t a bad thing though, trust me). 8 weeks in, the
										world was starting to wake up to the realization that there
										was something going on with this virus thing. I was flying
										to/from Orlando at the end of February. I recall going
										through the airports thinking that anyone wearing a mask was
										over reacting, that being said, I wasn’t getting too close
										to anyone back then.
									</p>

									<p>
										A couple of weeks later I was driving to Stillwater Oklahoma
										for a bicycle event, waiting for the orange president to
										come on the air and do a broadcast of what was going on,
										half expecting to turn around and drive back to St. Louis.
									</p>

									<p>
										I went in to 2020 planning to run the FR-S competitively
										nationally, performning well at the Solo Nationals and then
										sell the car at the end of the season, ready to move on to
										something else after 3 seasons.
									</p>

									<p>
										The season was cut short, Nationally only attending one
										event (a win) with the
										<a href="/2020-topeka-prosolo-results">Topeka ProSolo</a>
										and I ended up not attending the first two local St. Louis
										region events as I was concerned with Covid-19 and the risks
										associated with that. It wasn’t until the third event, June
										21st, that I really got out to compete.
									</p>

									<p>
										I ended up attending 7 of 9 St. Louis region events, taking
										the top PAX (index) finish at 5 of 7 events that I attended.
										For the year I ended up taking the index championship over
										Mitchell Coughran, 69,873 out of a possible 70,000 points.
										For the SSC class I ended up taking 7 of 7 class wins for
										the year.
									</p>

									<p>
										This was the second time (third if you throw the stupid 2008
										double points event out) I took the overall index
										championship for the St. Louis Region SCCA, the last time
										being in 2013 in Dave’s street mustang (what was the class
										back then, rsr?, I really don’t recall).
									</p>

									<p>
										I was also awarded the Driver of The Year award for 2020.
									</p>

									<p>
										What’s next for 2021? Well I ended up deciding not to sell
										the car. I am signed up for the ProSolo SuperPass, which
										really doesn’t mean too much other than I get to sign up
										early for events to make sure I get it. You don’t earn
										points for the ProSolo Finale this year like in the past, so
										if you get a ProSolo win, you’re in for the finale,
										otherwise you might get in by attending enough events.
									</p>

									<p>
										I am signed up for the Dixie tour down in southern Georgia
										in the middle of March, and I will likely run the Topeka
										ProSolo and possibly Spring Nationals if I don’t do the
										Unbound Gravel (200 miles) ride in Emporia KS the week after
										Spring Nationals.
									</p>

									<p>
										Local eventwise, I’ll be hitting what events I can. Never
										say never on trying to repeat with the index championship.
									</p>

									<p>
										2022, who knows, I imagine I will sell the FR-S at the end
										of this year, but again, never say never.
									</p>
