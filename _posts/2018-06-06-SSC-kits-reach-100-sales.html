 <p>The TireRack has announced that they have sold their 100th SSC kit! I have some insider knowledge that says they sold it before the Spring Nationals, but the announcement just came out today via the SoloMatters newsletter (hey look at that screenshot, <a href="https://www.chrishammond.com" target="_blank">who is that?</a>)!</p>
 
 <p>If you haven’t tried SSC out yet, you are missing out! This class is the future of Solo! </p>
<p>Speaking of Spring Nationals, stay tuned for our write up, we’re still trying to get caught up, but it should be up later this week! </p>
