The time has finally come, time that I finally have, to try to start getting the 2016 Scion FR-S parted out.

Yesterday I got the car unburried from the smaller side of the garage and pulled it into the bigger 2 car bay.

First things first, I got the car up on jackstands, after finding the wheel lock, and took the Konig wheels off the car. David Z picked those up from me yesterday afternoon, so the wheel and tires from the car are gone.

Next up I will be taking the SSC suspension bits, and the nameless exhaust, and replace them with the OEM parts. Once I have those off, hopefully in the next week, I'll be selling those.

Other things I need to do:

* need to get to the DMV and get the lean cleared off the title so I can easily part with the car/title.
* decide how much of what was removed will be put back on the car (front/rear bumper, lights, etc)

If you're interested in any of the car, or SSC bits, let me know.

Car is located in Wildwood Missouri, just outside of St. Louis. The motor has less than 45k miles on it and runs great.
