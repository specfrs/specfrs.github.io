The time has finally come, time that I finally have, to try to start getting the 2016 Scion FR-S parted out.

Yesterday I got the car unburried from the smaller side of the garage and pulled it into the bigger 2 car bay.

First things first, I got the car up on jackstands, after finding the wheel lock, and took the Konig wheels off the car. David Z picked those up from me yesterday afternoon, so the wheel and tires from the car are gone.

Next up I will be taking the SSC suspension bits, and the nameless exhaust, and replace them with the OEM parts. Once I have those off, hopefully in the next week, I'll be selling those.

Other things I need to do:

* need to get to the DMV and get the lean cleared off the title so I can easily part with the car/title.
* decide how much of what was removed will be put back on the car.
