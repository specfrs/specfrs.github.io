<p>With the parts installed on the car, it was time to get wheels and tires mounted/balanced and installed. I also needed to get an alignment on the car as I knew it wasn’t close to the autocross specs that Tire Rack had in their recommendations. So I took my car to the only place I trust for an <a href="http://www.soloperformance.com/alignment" target="_blank">autocross alignment</a> in Missouri, <a href="http://www.soloperformance.com/" target="_blank">Solo Performance Specialties</a>.</p>
<p>The tires mounted up nice and easy on the Konig Ampliforms, after I got the wheels with the <a href="http://specfrs.com/Blog/aid/6" target="_blank">right bolt pattern of course</a>. They were mounted onto the car and it was up on to the alignment rack next. </p>

<p>Dave at Solo Performance knows his stuff, so he was able to get the car setup as recommended.</p>

<p>Next up is the first St. Louis region autocross on April 15th. There are 3 SSC cars entered, so let’s see how this thing (and mainly this driver) does! </p>
