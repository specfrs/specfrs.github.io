<p>So one of the ways to help supplement the cost of autocross at a National level with the SCCA is to participate in their contingency programs. There are a variety of contingency options available, depending on:</p><ul><li>What make of car you drive</li><li>What class you run in</li><li>What tires you run</li><li>What programs you register for</li></ul><p>You should check out the <a href="https://www.scca.com/pages/solo-contingency" target="_blank">SCCA Autocross Contingency page</a> to see which options are available to you, and which will work for your particular class/car.</p>
<p>What’s the catch with contingencies? Well, you typically (almost always) have to run your vehicle with the sponsors decals on the vehicle. </p>

<p>For SSC, here are the contingencies that I believe to be applicable.</p><ul><li>TRD – ProSolo</li><li>Falken Tire – ProSolo &amp; Champ/Match Tours</li><li>Hawk Performance Brakes - ProSolo &amp; Champ/Match Tours</li><li><a href="http://www.soloperformance.com/" target="_blank">Solo Performance Specialties</a> – Champ/Match Tours</li><li>RaceChick.com – ProSolo (ladies)</li></ul>

<p>The amounts will all vary, but Falken for example will pay $300 for first, $200 for second and $100 for third. </p>
