<p>The time has come, Falken has updated the tire for SSC for 2020 with their latest and greatest Azenis RT660. I&rsquo;ll save you all the story about how there was testing in September (I couldn&rsquo;t stay for it), and how they were delayed getting to the states and you have the option of running either the RT-615k or the RT-660 for the 2020 season. All you really need to know is that the RT-660 is a much better tire, and highly recommended (required mostly) if you&rsquo;re running the SSC autocross class with the SCCA.</p>
<p>The tires are still a great price for SSC (as were the 615ks), I can currently get them from Tire Rack shipped to my door (or favorite installer) for $549!</p>
<p>I ran my first local event on these tires 2 days ago, and I am still on a euphoric high from their performance and my placement at the top of the PAX/Index results. These tires are a huge upgrade over the 615ks. That&rsquo;s not to say I didn&rsquo;t like the 615ks, I feel they served as a great tire for 2 years in the infancy of the Solo Spec Coupe class, but the 660s are so much more. They are sticky. They are fun, they are competitive!</p>
<p>I look forward to the rest of the 2020 season and have gone ahead and booked myself into the Topeka ProSolo this weekend in Kansas.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a video from our fastest run, Run #6, at the event, using our JD1 Camera Mount with a new GoPro Hero 8 Black</p>
