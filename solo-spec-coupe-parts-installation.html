										After a long couple of days working on the FR-S,

									<p>

											</li>
											<li>Three upper strut nuts (12).</li>
											<li>

											</li>
											<li>

											</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											<strong>Note*:</strong> If the cover does not give enough
											access, then the metal shield with four cover bolts (10),
											six shield bolts (12), and six plastic fasteners may have
											to be removed. One each of the three plastic fasteners on
											each side is underneath the fender liner towards the
											front.
										</p>
									</blockquote>

									<p>
										This is where I diverged from the instructions, getting to
										the sway bar mounts, I have no idea how anyone could remove
										the sway bar without removing the subframe connectors. I
										ended up taking both the metal tray under the engine, and
										the composite tray over the exhaust/transmission from the
										car in order to remove the subframe connectors which then
										drops the sway bar out of the car. Also in the Notes, there
										are 7 plastic fasteners on my car, one in the middle, that
										holds the metal tray.
									</p>
									<p>
										Next up was removal of the upper mount bearing from the
										stock strut. I ended up removing this without using a spring
										compressor, though I wouldn&rsquo;t recommend it. I have a
										bruise on my wrist from the mount popping off when the nut
										came free, definitely learned a lesson on this one! I did
										end up using the spring&nbsp;compressors to install the
										Eibach springs on the Konis up front.
									</p>
									<p>
										When assembling the front Struts, and the rears, be sure to
										figure out your dust boot situation. The Eibach springs,
										come with 2 new dust boots, I ended up putting these on the
										front struts, though other people have said they installed
										them on the Rear and reused the OEM fronts on the Koni
										fronts. I ended up using the OEM rear boots on the rear with
										the Konis and Eibachs.
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>
											Install new lower SPC camber bolt (15) with nut (17) to
											the front. Tab on SPC bolt horizontal to the outside for
											approximate maximum camber.
										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										The next point of clarification is related to the bolts used
										on the bottom of the front struts, there are two. When
										installing the new struts, use the SPC camber bolt on the
										bottom hole, and use the original bottom bolt (oem) in the
										upper hole. You can tell the difference between the two
										bolts by looking at the shafts. The original TOP bolt is
										thicker on one side, the bottom one is uniform and will give
										you more adjustment for camber by installing it at the top
										position. I saved the original top bolt with all the rest of
										the OEM parts.
									</p>
									<p>
										How do you mount the SPC bolt?
										<a
											href="http://www.spcalignment.com/instructions/81305-INS_WEB.pdf"
											target="_blank"
											>Read the instructions here</a
										>.
									</p>
									<p>
										Moving on to the Rear of the car, you&rsquo;ll come across
										this in the instructions
									</p>
									<ul>
										<li>Three upper shock nuts (12).</li>
									</ul>
									<p>
										That line is incorrect, it should be Two upper shock nuts,
										and I think they are 14s, not 12s.
									</p>
									<p>
										Putting the rear shocks together, I ended up using the
										spring compressor to remove the OEM upper mount, but
										assembling the Konis I ended up compressing it by hand. I
										was able to press down on the shock mount enough to thread
										the nut onto the shaft of the Konis and run the nut down by
										hand with a socket. This is a much easier job if you have a
										second person to assist, one to compress and one to turn the
										nut down.
